# Crash-2

A remake of the popular Crash Landing modpack.

## Getting Started

To build or test the modpack locally, you'll need [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/), a command-line tool for managing modpacks.

### Build the Modpack

```bash
# Build the modpack file for testing
packwiz modrinth export
```
This will generate a .mrpack file that you can import into the Modrinth App to test the modpack.
