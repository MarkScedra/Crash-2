You have survived a crash landing on Planet T4L0S, an uncharted planet in the Varkin system. Preliminary scans indicate an arid environment with pockets of elevated radiation, high mineral content, and subterranean hydrocarbon reservoirs.

You will need to brave the blazing heat, find sources of food and water, scour the planet for resources, build up technology, and search for a way to escape the planet.

Desolate Planet is a challenging, quest-based modpack where you must struggle for survival on a dust planet with limited resources. The map is set to hardcore, you must use the [Sync](https://modrinth.com/mod/sync-fabric-rereported/) mod to build yourself more lives.

## FAQ

### Q: How do I install the modpack?

A: Download the Modrinth or Curseforge app, search for the name of the pack, and click install. Make sure you are using 6-8 GB of RAM in the modpack or launcher’s settings.

### Q: How can I play multiplayer? Do you have a server pack?
A: If you *aren't* experienced in server hosting, download the [Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential) mod. Many players have had positive experiences with how easy it is to use. If you *are* experienced in server hosting, you can download the server pack, included in most modpack releases (go to the versions page, select the newest one, and scroll all the way down past the mod list).

### Q: Why does my game/world gets stuck while loading in?

A: Make sure you have allocated at least 6 GB of RAM to the modpack. I usually recommend 8 GB if your computer has enough.

### Q: How can I disabled hardcore?

A: I strongly recommend learning to use the sync shells for extra lives, it’s what the game was balanced around. If you select the easy route, you’ll start with enough power for 3 shells. Follow the steps in the Sync quest for a detailed guide.
However, if you’ve tried that and still want to disable hardcore, you can edit the hardcore setting in `config/globalgamerules-common.toml`. On a server, the steps are slightly different. Download [this file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5UhUxAD/versions/YopX3hzh/Non-Hardcore_Server_Files.zip) and replace the files on the server with the files in that zip. I recommend backing up the target files before replacing them.

### Q: How do I get seared bricks/grout for a smeltery?

A: There is a Tinker’s Construct smeltery building in the cities, containing crumbling seared brick blocks. Break those with a hammer or pulverize them to get seared bricks.

### Q: What is the best power source?

A: The quests include 3 recommended energy sources. The first is the *Pitiful Generator*, which is powered by burnable fuel and very inefficient. Once you get oil refining set up, you can use the *Compression Dynamo* to burn various types of oils. Finally, you can get a *Nuclear Reactor* in the end-game, which is a highly effective generation method. The quests will guide you through these three recommended methods, but you can build a few other types on the way if you'd like.

### Q: Will updating to a new version break my world?

A: Generally no, you won’t have any issues. Only major releases break anything and there will be a description of exactly what they break near the start of the changelog. However, it is always a good idea to frequently back up your world.
